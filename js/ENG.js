        main_text: 'My name is Martí Quintana, I’m 20 years old and I’m from Barcelona. <br><br>Since 2017 I’ve been studying a vocational training in the Software field called “Desenvolupament d’Aplicacions Multiplataforma” and “Desenvolupament d’Aplicacions Web”. I studied in “Centre d’Estudis Politècnics”, located in “Plaça Urquinaona”, Barcelona. This current year, 2020, I’m finishing my second degree (I finished the first one in 2019). <br><br>In these three years, I’ve learned a lot of things related to the Computer Science field. For example, I’ve learned how a computers works, how to program applications for mobile phones, how to program desktop applications, how to program web applications, also I know how to work with databases (SQL).<br><span id="dots">...</span><span class="more"><br>Last year, I went to London to do the internship in an foreign company called GJQ Holdings LTD, located in Camden. There I learned PHP, JavaScript, Google Analytics, and the Laravel Framework. I could do my internship abroad because a grant, which I get by a contest, provided by “Centre d’Estudis Politècnics” and the Eramus+ program.<br><br>Moving aside from my College studies, in these three years, I got the Outdoor Activities Instructor title. This title allows me to do outdoor activities (mountain, beach, trekking…) in charge of kids and young people. Also I’ve been a volunteer, as an Instructor, in “Agrupament Escolta Tant Com Puc”, in El Vendrell, Tarragona. An “Agrupament Escolta” is an association which has some similitudes with the boy scouts of America.</span>' ,
        sec_text: 'Also I can play some musicals instruments like the flute, the accordion or the bass guitar. Also, I can play some traditional instruments like the“Gralla” or the “Tarota” which are very ancient. In the languages field I’m very fluent in Spanish and Catalan and I’m quite fluent in English.'

        main_text: 'As I said before I\'ve been an Outdoor Activities Instructor for a two years but also I was a volunteer in “Casal d’Infants del Raval” for three     years, a place where I was in charge of kids who were in risk of social exclusion.These two experiences made me improve my soft skills into another level. I’ve become a social person who can fit almost in every group of people or work team.While I’ve been studying this vocational training, I’ve developed some skills in the Software field, I’ve learned how to think as a programmer, which I think is the most important think. Also I consider that I can work well under pressure.<br>',
